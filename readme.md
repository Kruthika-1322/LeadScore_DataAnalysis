Lead Scoring Model - X Education
Project Overview
X Education, an online course provider, faces a challenge with a low lead conversion rate (~30%). Despite generating numerous leads daily, only a fraction convert into paying customers. To improve sales efficiency, this project builds a Lead Scoring Model using Logistic Regression to prioritize high-potential leads, aiming to boost the conversion rate to ~80%.

Files in This Repository
The project contains the following files:

Lead Score Assignment_presentation.pdf – A PowerPoint presentation (in PDF format) summarizing the key insights, methodology, and results of the analysis.
Brief summary report.pdf – A detailed summary report explaining the data preparation, feature selection, model building, and evaluation processes.
Assignment Subjective Questions - answer included.pdf – A document containing responses to subjective questions related to the project.
Final - Logistic Regression Model - Education - Group case study.ipynb – The Jupyter Notebook where the entire data analysis, model development, and evaluation have been carried out.

Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Handled missing values and removed redundant features.
Applied categorical encoding and outlier analysis.
Selected important features using RFE and VIF analysis.
Model Building & Evaluation

Trained a Logistic Regression model to predict lead conversions.
Evaluated performance using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and confusion matrix.
Recommendations & Strategy

Provided a structured lead prioritization strategy for the sales team.
Suggested best call timings, multi-touch follow-ups, and urgency-based incentives to maximize conversions.
How to Use the Notebook (Lead_Scoring_Model.ipynb)
Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab.
Run the data preprocessing steps to clean and transform the dataset.
Execute the Logistic Regression model training and evaluation.
Review the model performance metrics and lead prioritization insights.

Conclusion
This project provides a data-driven approach to help X Education optimize lead conversion efforts. By implementing the proposed strategies, the sales team can focus on high-potential leads, increase efficiency, and improve conversion rates.
