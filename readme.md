# Lead Scoring Model - X Education

## Project Overview
X Education, an online course provider, faces a challenge with a low lead conversion rate (~30%). Despite generating numerous leads daily, only a fraction convert into paying customers. To improve sales efficiency, this project builds a Lead Scoring Model using Logistic Regression to prioritize high-potential leads, aiming to boost the conversion rate to ~80%.

## Files in This Repository
The project contains the following files:

- **Lead Score Assignment_presentation.pdf** – A PowerPoint presentation (in PDF format) summarizing the key insights, methodology, and results of the analysis.
- **Brief summary report.pdf** – A detailed summary report explaining the data preparation, feature selection, model building, and evaluation processes.
- **Assignment Subjective Questions - answer included.pdf** – A document containing responses to subjective questions related to the project.
- **Final - Logistic Regression Model - Education - Group case study.ipynb** – The Jupyter Notebook where the entire data analysis, model development, and evaluation have been carried out.

## Project Workflow
### 1. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Handled missing values and removed redundant features.
- Applied categorical encoding and outlier analysis.
- Selected important features using RFE and VIF analysis.

### 2. Model Building & Evaluation
- Trained a Logistic Regression model to predict lead conversions.
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and confusion matrix.

### 3. Recommendations & Strategy
- Provided a structured lead prioritization strategy for the sales team.
- Suggested best call timings, multi-touch follow-ups, and urgency-based incentives to maximize conversions.

## How to Use the Notebook (`Lead_Scoring_Model.ipynb`)
1. Open the notebook in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.
2. Run the data preprocessing steps to clean and transform the dataset.
3. Execute the Logistic Regression model training and evaluation.
4. Review the model performance metrics and lead prioritization insights.

## Conclusion
This project provides a data-driven approach to help X Education optimize lead conversion efforts. By implementing the proposed strategies, the sales team can focus on high-potential leads, increase efficiency, and improve conversion rates.
